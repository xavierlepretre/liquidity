Liquidity Reference
===================

Contract Format
---------------

All the contracts have the following form::

 [%%version 0.4]

 <... local declarations ...>

 type storage = TYPE

 let%init storage
     (x : TYPE)
     (y : TYPE)
     ... =
     BODY

 let%entry entrypoint1
     (p1 : TYPE)
     (s1 : TYPE) =
     BODY

 let%entry entrypoint2
     (p2 : TYPE)
     (s2 : TYPE) =
     BODY

 let%entry main
     (parameter : TYPE)
     (storage : TYPE) =
     BODY

  ...

The optional ``version`` statement tells the compiler in which version
of Liquidity the contract is written. The compiler will reject any
contract that has a version that it does not understand (too old, more
recent).

A contract is composed of type declarations, local values definitions,
an initializer, and a set of entry points. The type ``storage`` must
be defined for all contracts.

Each entry point is a special function declared with the keyword
``let%entry``. An entry point must have two arguments, the first one
being the parameter (which must be type annotated) and the second one
is the storage (type annotation optional). The return type of the
function can be specified but is not necessary. Each entry point must
be given a unique name within the same contract.

If there is an entry point named ``main``, it will be the default
entry point for the contract, *i.e.* the one that is called when the
entry point is not specified in ``Contract.call``.

An entry point always returns a pair ``(operations, storage)``, where
``operations`` is a list of internal operations to perform after
execution of the contract, and ``storage`` is the final state of the
contract after the call. The type of the pair must match the type of a
pair where the first component is a list of opertations and the second
is the type of the storage argument.

``<... local declarations ...>`` is an optional set of optional type,
function and extended primitives declarations. Type declarations can be
used to define records and variants (sum-types), described later in this
documentation.

An optional initial storage or storage initializer can be given with
``let%init storage``. When deploying a Liquidity contract, if the
storage is not constant it is evaluated in the head context.

Basic Types and Values
----------------------

Types in Liquidity are monomorphic. They are all inherited from
Michelson, except for algebraic data types and records, that are
translated to Michelson types.

Basic Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

The built-in base types are:

- ``unit``: whose only constructor is ``()``
- ``bool``: Booleans
- ``int``: Unbounded integers
- ``nat``: Unbounded naturals (positive integers)
- ``tez``: The type of amounts
- ``string``: character strings
- ``bytes``: bytes sequences
- ``timestamp``: dates and timestamps
- ``key``: cryptographic keys
- ``key_hash``: hashes of cryptographic keys
- ``signature``: cryptographic signatures
- ``operation``: type of operations, can only be constructed
- ``address``: abstract type of contract addresses

Composite Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Types can be composed using the following type operators:

- tuples: noted ``t1 * t2``, ``t1 * t2 * t3``, etc.
- functions: ``'a -> 'b`` is the type of functions from ``'a`` to
  ``'b``, equivalent to ``('a, 'b) lambda``.

and the following predefined combinators:

- lists: ``'a list`` is the type of lists of elements in ``'a``
- sets: ``'a set`` is the type of sets of elements in ``'a`` (``'a`` must be a comparable type)
- maps: ``('key, 'val) map`` is the type of maps whose keys are of type
  ``'key``, a comparable type, and values of type ``'val``;
- big maps: ``('key, 'val) big_map`` is the type of lazily
  deserialized maps whose keys are of type ``'key`` (a comparable
  type) and values of type ``'val``;
- contracts: ``S.instance`` is the type of contracts (instances) of signature
  ``S`` (see `Contract Types and Signatures`_);

and the predefined algebraic data types:

- option type: ``'a option = None | Some of 'a``
- variant type: ``('a, 'b) variant = Left of 'a | Right of 'b``

Record and variant types must be declared beforehand and are referred
to by their names.

User defined types can be parameterized by type variables. See
`Polymorphism`_ for the specifics and limitations.


Constant Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The unique constructor of type ``unit`` is ``()``.

The two Booleans (``bool``) constants are:

* ``true``
* ``false``

As in Michelson, there are different types of integers:

* ``int`` : an unbounded integer, positive or negative, simply written
  ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, ``-1``, ``-2``, ...
* ``nat`` : an unbounded positive integer, written either with a ``p``
  suffix (``0p``, ``12p``, etc.) or as an integer with a type coercion
  ( ``(0 : nat)`` ).
* ``tez`` : an unbounded positive float of Tezzies, written either
  with a ``tz`` suffix (``1.00tz``, etc.) or as a string with type
  coercion (``("1.00" : tez)``).

Strings (``string``) are delimited by the characters ``"`` and ``"``.

Bytes (``bytes``) are sequences of hexadecimal pairs preceeded by ``0x``, for
instance:

* ``0x``
* ``0xabcdef``

Timestamps (``timestamp``) are written in ISO 8601 format, like in Michelson:

* ``2015-12-01T10:01:00+01:00``

Keys, key hashes and signatures are base58-check encoded, the same as in Michelson:

* ``tz1YLtLqD1fWHthSVHPD116oYvsd4PTAHUoc`` is a key hash (``key_hash``)
* ``edpkuit3FiCUhd6pmqf9ztUTdUs1isMTbF9RBGfwKk1ZrdTmeP9ypN`` is a public
  key (``key``)
*
  ``edsigedsigthTzJ8X7MPmNeEwybRAvdxS1pupqcM5Mk4uCuyZAe7uEk68YpuGDeViW8wSXMrCi5CwoNgqs8V2w8ayB5dMJzrYCHhD8C7`` is a signature (``signature``)

There are also three types of collections: lists, sets and
maps. Constants collections can be created directly:

* Lists: ``["x"; "y"]`` for a ``string list``;
* Sets: ``Set [1; 2; 3; 4]`` for an ``int set``;
* Maps: ``Map [1, "x"; 2, "y"; 3, "z"]`` for a ``(int, string) map``;
* Big maps: ``BigMap [1, "x"; 2, "y"; 3, "z"]`` for a ``(int, string) big_map``

Options (``option``) can be defined with:

* An empty option: ``None``
* A valued option: ``Some 3``

Variants (``variant``) can be defined with:

* Left alternative: ``Left "hello"``
* Right alternative: ``Right 3``

for a ``(string, int) variant``.

The ``variant`` type is not supposed to be used by programmers, who
can defined their own algebraic data types. Instead, ``variant`` is
used when decompiling Michelson code.

It is also possible to coerce some constants between their inferred
type and another compatible type, using the notation
``( CONSTANT : NEWTYPE )``:

* A ``string`` can be coerced to ``tez`` (the string must contain an
  integer in mutez Ã  la Michelson), ``timestamp``, ``key``,
  ``address``, ``_ contract``, ``key_hash`` and ``signature``.
* A ``bytes`` can be coerced to ``address``, ``_.instance``, ``key``,
  ``key_hash`` and ``signature``.
* An ``address`` can be coerced to ``_.instance``.
* A ``_.instance`` can be coerced to ``address``.
* A ``key_hash`` can be coerced to ``UnitContract.instance`` and ``address``.

Starting with version ``0.5``, constant values such as ``[]``,
``Map``, ``Set``, ``None`` do not need to be annotated with their type
anymore. It will be inferred (when possible), see `Type inference`_).

Predefined Primitives
---------------------

There are two kinds of primitives in the language:

* **Prefix primitives** are used by putting the primitive before the
  arguments: ``prim x y z``. All alphanumerical primitives are prefix
  primitives, except ``lor``, ``lxor``, ``mod``, ``land``, ``lsl``,
  ``lsr`` and ``asr``.
* **Infix primitives** are used by putting the primitive between the
  arguments: ``x prim y``. Infix primitives are always operators
  (``+``, ``-``, etc.).

When the type of a primitive is specified, we extend the notation for
functions like this:

* ``TYPE_ARG -> TYPE_RESULT`` for a primitive with one argument
* ``TYPE_ARG1 -> TYPE_ARG2 -> TYPE_RESULT`` for a primitive with two arguments

Whereas functions can only take one argument in Liquidity/Michelson
(possibly a tuple), primitives can take multiple arguments.

Extended Primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional prefix Michelson primitives can be added to the language
through a local declaration as follows:

``external prim_name : TYPE1 -> ... -> TYPE_ARG1 -> ... -> TYPE_RESULT = "MINST" FLAGS``

Such declaration takes as input an arbitrary number of type arguments
(``TYPE1 -> ...``) of the form ``[%type: 'a]``, where ``'a`` is the
variable bound to the type.

Then follows an arbitrary (but non-null) number of typed arguments
(``TYPE_ARG1 -> ...``) of the form ``[%stack: TYPE]``, where ``TYPE``
corresponds to any Michelson type, possibly containing one or more of
the type variables introduced previously. Here, ``%stack`` means the
argument resides on the stack. It is mandatory for all arguments,
except when declaring a primitive that takes no argument, in which
case it takes a single argument of type ``unit``, without the
``%stack`` specifier (``[%stack: unit]`` would instead mean
that the primitive takes a unit value from the stack).

The result type (``TYPE_RESULT``) is specified using the same form as
arguments, i.e. ``[%stack: TYPE]``, where a bare ``unit`` indicates
a primitive that does not produce any value on the stack. It is
also possible to specify that the primitive returns several
values on the stack using a tuple notation :
``[%stack: TYPE1] * [%stack: TYPE2] * ...``. In this case, every
component of the tuple must have a ``%stack`` specifier and will
occupy a different stack cell. All the values will be assembled
into an actual tuple before being returned to Liquidity.

``MINST`` is the actual Michelson instruction to generate and will
be written as-is in the output file, followed by the given type
arguments, if any.

``FLAGS`` allows to give additional information about the primitive.
Currently, the only supported flag is ``[@@effect]``, which specifies
that the primitive may have side-effects. This prevents calls to
this primitive from being inlined or eliminated when the return
value is not used.

A call to an extended primitive is then performed as follows:

``prim_name TYPE1 ... ARG1 ...``

After the primitive name, a number of type arguments (``TYPE1 ...``)
of the form ``[%type: TYPE]`` may be given (if the primitive has
been declared to take type arguments), where ``TYPE`` is any
Michelson type. Then follow the actual arguments (``ARG1 ...``).


Comparison between values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All values are not comparable. Only two values of the following types
can be compared with each other:

* ``bool``
* ``int``
* ``nat``
* ``tez``
* ``string``
* ``bytes``
* ``timestamp``
* ``key_hash``
* ``address``

The following comparison operators are available:

* ``=`` : equal
* ``<>`` : not-equal
* ``<`` : strictly less
* ``<=`` : less or equal
* ``>`` : strictly greater
* ``>=`` : greater or equal

There is also a function ``compare : 'a -> 'a -> int`` to compare two
values and return an integer, as follows. ``compare x y``

* returns 0 if ``x`` and ``y`` are equal
* returns a strictly positive integer if ``x > y``
* returns a strictly negative integer if ``x < y``

The ``Current`` module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Current.balance: unit -> tez``: returns the balance of the current
  contract. The balance contains the amount of tez that was sent by
  the current operation. It is translated to ``BALANCE`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc1.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc1.liq

* ``Current.time: unit -> timestamp``: returns the timestamp of the
  block in which the transaction is included. This value is chosen by
  the baker that is including the transaction, so it should not be
  used as a reliable source of alea.  It is translated to ``NOW`` in
  Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc2.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc2.liq

* ``Current.amount: unit -> tez``: returns the amount of tez
  transferred by the current operation (standard or internal
  transaction). It is translated to ``AMOUNT`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc3.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc3.liq

* ``Current.gas: unit -> nat``: returns the amount of gas available to
  execute the rest of the transaction. It is translated to
  ``STEPS_TO_QUOTA`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc4.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc4.liq

* ``Current.source: unit -> address``: returns the address that
  initiated the current top-level transaction in the blockchain. It is
  the same one for all the transactions resulting from the top-level
  transaction, standard and internal. It is the address that paid the
  fees and storage cost, and signed the operation on the
  blockchain. It is translated to ``SOURCE`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc5.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc5.liq

* ``Current.sender: unit -> address``: returns the address that
  initiated the current transaction. It is the same as the source for
  the top-level transaction, but it is the originating contract for
  internal operations. It is translated to ``SENDER`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc6.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc6.liq

* ``failwith`` or ``Current.failwith: 'a -> 'b``: makes the current
  transaction and all its internal transactions fail. No modification
  is done to the context. The argument can be any value (often a
  string and some argument), the system will display it to explain why
  the transaction failed.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc7.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc7.liq

Operations on tuples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``get t n``, ``Array.get t n`` and ``t.(n)`` where ``n`` is a
  constant positive-or-nul int: returns the ``n``-th element of the
  tuple ``t``. Tuples are translated to Michelson by pairing on the
  right, i.e. ``(a,b,c,d)`` becomes ``(a, (b, (c, d)))``. In this
  example, ``a`` is the ``0``-th element.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc8.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc8.liq

* ``set t n x``, ``Array.set t n x`` and ``t.(n) <- x`` where ``n`` is
  constant positive-or-nul int: returns the tuple where the ``n``-th element
  has been replaced by ``x``.

    Instead of using ``is_nat``, it is recommended to use a specific form
    of pattern matching:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc13.liq

* ``<c.entry>: 'parameter -> amount:tez -> operation``. Forge an

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc14.liq

* ``Account.transfer: dest:key_hash -> amount:tez ->
  operation``. Forge an internal transaction to the implicit (_i.e._
  default) account contract of ``dest``. Arguments can be labeled, in
  which case they can be given in any order. *The resulting operation
  cannot fail (if the transfer amount leaves more than 0.257tz on both
  contracts).*

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc15.liq

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc16.liq

* ``Account.default: key_hash -> UnitContract.instance``. Returns
  the contract associated to the given ``key_hash``. Since this
  contract is not originated, it cannot contain code, so transfers to
  it cannot fail. It is translated to ``IMPLICIT_ACCOUNT`` in
  Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc17.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc17.liq

* ``Contract.set_delegate: key_hash option -> operation``. Forge a
  delegation operation for the current contract. A ``None`` argument
  means that the contract should have no delegate (it falls back to
  its manager). The delegation operation will only be executed in an
  internal operation if it is returned at the end of the ``%entry``
  function. It is translated to ``SET_DELEGATE`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc18.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc18.liq

  spendable:bool -> delegatable:bool -> amount:tez -> storage:'storage
  -> code:(contract _) -> (operation, address)``. Forge an operation
  to originate a contract with code. The contract is only created when
  the operation is executed, so it must be returned by the
  transaction. Note that the code must be specified as a contract
  structure (inlined or not). It is translated to ``CREATE_CONTRACT``
  in Michelson.  ``Contract.create manager delegate_opt spendable
  delegatable initial_amount initial_storage (contract C)`` forges
  an origination operation for contract `C` with manager ``manager``,
  optional delegate ``delegate``, Boolean spendable flag
  ``spendable``, Boolean delegatable flag ``delegatable``, initial
  balance ``initial_amount`` and initial storage
  ``initial_storage``. Arguments can be named and put in any order.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc39.liq

Operations on lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lists are immutable data structures containing values (of any type)
that can only be accessed in a sequential order. Since they are
immutable, all **modification** primitives return a new list, and the
list given in argument is unmodified.

* ``( :: ) : 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list``. Add a new element at the head
  of the list. The previous list becomes the tail of the new list.  It
  is translated to ``CONS`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc40.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc40.liq

* ``List.rev : 'a list -> 'a list``. Return the list in the reverse order.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc41.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc41.liq

  of the list. It is translated to ``SIZE`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc42.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc42.liq

* ``List.iter: ('a -> unit) -> 'a list -> unit``. Iterate the function on
  all the elements of a list. Since no value can be returned, it can
  only be used for side effects, i.e. to fail the transaction.  It is
  translated to ``ITER`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc43.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc43.liq

* ``List.fold: ('elt * 'acc -> 'acc) -> 'elt list -> 'acc ->
  'acc``. Iterate on all elements of a list, while modifying an
  accumulator. It is translated to ``ITER`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc44.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc44.liq

* ``List.map: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list``. Return a
  list with the result of applying the function on each element of the
  list. It is translated to ``MAP`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc45.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc45.liq

* ``List.map_fold: ('a * 'acc -> 'b * 'acc) -> 'a list -> 'acc
  -> 'b list * 'acc``.  Return a list with the result of applying the
  function on each element of the list, plus an accumulator. It is
  translated to ``MAP`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc46.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc46.liq

Operations on sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets are immutable data structures containing unique values (a
comparable type). Since they are immutable, all **modification**
primitives return a new updated set, and the set given in argument is
unmodified.

* ``Set.update: 'a -> bool -> 'a set -> 'a set``. Update a set for a
  particular element. If the boolean is ``true``, the element is
  added. If the boolean is ``false``, the element is removed. It is
  translated to ``UPDATE`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc47.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc47.liq

* ``Set.add: 'a -> 'a set -> 'a set`` . Add an element to a set, if
  not present. ``Set.add x s`` is syntactic sugar for ``Set.update
  x true s``.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc48.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc48.liq

* ``Set.remove: 'a -> 'a set -> 'a set``. Remove an element to a
  set, if present. ``Set.remove x s`` is syntactic sugar for ``Set.update
  x false s``.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc49.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc49.liq

* ``Set.mem: 'a -> 'a set -> bool``. Return ``true`` if the element is
  in the set, ``false`` otherwise. It is translated to ``MEM`` in
  Michelson.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc51.liq

* ``Set.iter: ('ele -> unit) -> 'ele set -> unit``. Apply a function
  on all elements of the set. Since no value can be returned, it can

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc52.liq

Operations on maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maps are immutable data structures containing associations between
keys (a comparable type) and values (any type). Since they are
immutable, all **modification** primitives return a new updated map,
and the map given in argument is unmodified.

* ``Map.add: 'key -> 'val -> ('key, 'val) map -> ('key, 'val)
  map``. Return a map with a new association between a key and a
  value. If an association previously existed for the same key, it is
  not present in the new map. It is translated with ``UPDATE`` in
  Michelson.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc56.liq

* ``Map.remove: 'key -> ('key,'val) map -> ('key,'val) map``. Return a
  map where any associated with the key has been removed. It is
  translated with ``UPDATE`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc57.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc57.liq

* ``Map.find: 'key -> ('key,'val) map -> 'val option``. Return the
  value associated with a key in the map. It is translated to ``GET``
  in Michelson.

* ``Map.update: 'key -> 'val option -> ('key,'val) map -> ('key,'val)
  map``. Return a new map where the association between the key and

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc61.liq

* ``Map.iter: ('key * 'val -> unit) -> ('key,'val) map ->
  unit``. Apply a function on all associations in the map. Since no
  value can be returned, it can only be used for side effects, i.e. to
  fail the transaction. It is translated to ``ITER`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc62.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc62.liq

* ``Map.fold: (('key * 'val) * 'acc -> 'acc) -> ('key,'val) map ->

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc65.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc65.liq


Operations on Big maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Big maps are a specific kind of maps, optimized for storing. They can
be updated incrementally and scale to a high number of associations,
whereas standard maps will have an expensive serialization and
deserialization cost. You are limited by Michelson to one big map per
smart contract, that should appear as the first element of the
storage. Big maps cannot be iterated.

* ``Map.find: 'key -> ('key,'val) big_map -> 'val option``. Return the
  value associated with a key in the map. It is translated to ``GET``
  in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc66.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc66.liq

* ``Map.mem: 'key -> ('key, 'val) big_map -> bool``. Return ``true`` if an
  association exists in the map for the key, ``false`` otherwise. It
  is translated to ``MEM`` in Michelson.

  .. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc67.liq
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc67.liq

* ``Map.update: 'key -> 'val option -> ('key,'val) big_map -> ('key,'val)
  big_map``. Return a new map where the association between the key and
  the value has been removed (case ``None``) or added/updated (case
  ``Some v``). It is translated to ``UPDATE`` in Michelson.

* ``Map.add: 'key -> 'val -> ('key, 'val) big_map -> ('key, 'val)
  big_map``. Syntactic sugar for ``Map.update (Some ...)``.

* ``Map.remove: 'key -> ('key,'val) big_map -> ('key,'val) big_map``.
  Syntactic sugar for ``Map.update None``.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc68.liq

Operations on generic collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These primitives should not be used directly in Liquidity. They are
only used by the decompiler. They are automatically replaced during
typing by the corresponding primitive for the collection of the
argument (in either ``List``, ``Set``, ``Map``, ``String`` or
``Bytes``). However, they can be used to write some polymorphic code on
collections.

* ``Coll.update``
* ``Coll.mem``
* ``Coll.find``
* ``Coll.size``
* ``Coll.concat``
* ``Coll.slice``
* ``Coll.iter``
* ``Coll.fold``
* ``Coll.map``
* ``Coll.map_fold``


The Module-like Contract System
-------------------------------

The system described in this section allows to define several
contracts in the same file, to reference contracts by their names, and
to call contracts defined in other files.

Contract Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The notion of *contract structure* in Liquidity is a way to define
namespaces and to encapsulate types and contracts in packages. These
packages are called structures and are introduced with the ``struct``
keyword. They contain the exact same syntax elements that are allowed
to define contracts (see `Contract Format`_). These contract
structures are given names with the keyword ``contract``.

For instance the following structure defines a contract named ``C``
with a single entry point ``main``:

.. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc69.liq
.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc69.liq
   :end-at: end

Components of ``C`` can later be referred to using identifiers
qualified (with a dot ``.``) by the contract name ``C``:

- ``C.storage`` can be used as a type
- ``succ`` cannot be called from outside the contract

Contracts can also be used as first class values:

.. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc23.liq
.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc23.liq

**Instances** of contracts can be called with three different syntaxes:

- ``Contract.call ~dest:c ~amount:1tz ~parameter:"hello"``
- ``Contract.call ~dest:c ~amount:1tz ~entry:main ~parameter:"hello"``
- ``c.main "hello" ~amount:1tz``

These calls are all equivalent.

Toplevel Contracts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A contract defined at toplevel in a file ``path/to/my_contract.liq``
implicitly defines a contract structure named ``My_contract`` which
can be called in other Liquidity files.


Contract Types and Signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A contract is a first class object in Liquidity only for the
instruction ``Contract.create``, while contract *instances* can be
used like any other values. Contract signatures are introduced with
the keyword ``sig`` and defined with the keyword ``contract type``::

  contract type S = sig
    type storage = int
    val%entry entry1 : p1:TYPE -> s1:TYPE -> operation list * storage
    val%entry entry2 : p2:TYPE -> s2:TYPE -> operation list * storage
    val%entry main : TYPE -> TYPE -> operation list * storage
    ...
  end

A contract signature contains a declaration for the type ``storage``
(this type can be abstract from the outside of the contract), and
declarations for the entry point signatures with the special keyword
``val%entry`` (names of argument can be specified).

The type of a contract (instance) whose signature is `S` is written
``S.instance``. Note that ``S`` must be declared as a contract signature
beforehand if we want to declare values of type ``S.instance``.

For example::

  type t = {
    counter : int;
    dest : S.instance;
  }

is a record type with a contract field ``dest`` of signature ``S``.


Predefined Contract Signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The contract signature ``UnitContract`` is built-in, in Liquidity, and
stands for contracts with a single entry point ``main`` whose
parameter is of type ``unit``:

.. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc70.liq
.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc70.liq


Type inference and Polymorphism
-------------------------------

A new addition of version ``0.5`` of the Liquidity compiler is a type
inference algorithm (a variant of Hindley-Milner type inference) which
works in the presence of parametric types and polymorphic values
(functions) and can infer parametric types.

Type inference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A consequence of this addition is that most type annotations in
Liquidity are now unnecessary, but can be used to restrict types or to
enforce a constraint. This makes programs more readable by removing
superfluous noise.

In particular, types of entry point parameters, storage initializer
parameters, constant values (like ``[]``, ``None``, *etc.*) and
functions are not necessary anymore.

The following example shows type inference at work.

.. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc71.liq
.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc71.liq

Polymorphism
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, values in Liquidity cannot be polymorphic: type variables
must (and will) be instantiated (by inference and
monomorphization). This restriction is inherited from
Michelson. However there is still a way to write *polymorphic
functions*. This is especially useful to write reusable
code. Polymorphic functions are transformed into several monomorphized
versions. For instance a function ``f : 'a option -> int`` will be
transformed into two functions ``f_i : int option`` and
``f_Ln : nat list option`` if it is used with both an integer argument
and a list of naturals argument in the code.

To make this extension even more useful, Liquidity allows user
declared type to be *parameterized* by one or more type
variables. Every type variable that appears in the type definition
must also appear in the type name declaration (on the left hand side).

The following example defines a record type ``('a, 'b) t`` with two
fields whose type are parameters. The function ``mk_t`` builds values
of type ``t`` with it argument. ``mk_t`` has the polymorphic type
``mk_t : ('a * 'b) -> ('a, b') t``.

.. tryliquidity:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc72.liq
.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tests/doc/doc72.liq

The type of storage cannot be polymorphic, however it can contain
*weak type variables* (like ``'_a``), which means they must be the
same for every instance (*i.e.* there can only be one instance of type
``storage``). For example writing ``type '_a storage = '_a`` allows
type storage to be inferred.

ReasonML Syntax
---------------

Liquidity supports two syntaxes:

* OCaml syntax (OCaml with Tezos-specific changes)
* `ReasonML syntax <https://reasonml.github.io/>`_ (with Tezos-specific changes)

ReasonML Compiler Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the compiler expects the OCaml syntax, and outputs
files in OCaml syntax. This behavior changes with the file extension
and with the ``--re`` argument.  Files that end in ``.reliq`` will be
parsed as ReasonML Liquidity files. The decompiler will ouptut files in
ReasonML syntax when given the flag ``-re``. If your file is
``test.reliq``, you can compile it using::

  liquidity test.reliq

You can also convert a file from one syntax to another, using the
``--convert FILE`` argument. For example, a file in OCaml-syntax can
be converted to ReasonML syntax::

  $ liquidity --convert test19.liq
  %version
  0.5;

  type storage = {
    key,
    hash: bytes,
    c: address,
  };

  let%init storage: storage = {
    key: 0x0085b1e4560f47f089d7b97aabcf46937a4c137a9c3f96f73f20c83621694e36d5,
    hash: 0xabcdef,
    c: KT1LLcCCB9Fr1hrkGzfdiJ9u3ZajbdckBFrF,
  };

  contract PlusOne = {
    type storage = int;

    type t =
      | A
      | B;

    let%init init_storage = (x: bool, y: int) =>
      if (x == false) {
        0;
      } else {
        y;
      };

    let%entry main = (_: unit, s) => ([], s + 1);
  };

  let%entry main = (sign: signature, storage) => {
    let x = PlusOne.A;
    switch (x) {
    | PlusOne.B => failwith()
    | _ => ()
    };

    let key_hash = Crypto.hash_key(storage.key);
    if (key_hash == tz1KqTpEZ7Yob7QbPE4Hy4Wo8fHG8LhKxZSx) {
      Current.failwith();
    };
    if (key_hash
        == Crypto.hash_key(
             edpkuTXkJDGcFd5nh6VvMz8phXxU3Bi7h6hqgywNFi1vZTfQNnS1RV,
           )) {
      Current.failwith();
    };
    let delegate = Some(key_hash);
    let spendable = Crypto.check(storage.key, sign, storage.hash);
    let amount = Current.amount();
    let amount =
      switch (amount / 2p) {
      | None => Current.failwith()
      | Some(qr) => qr
      };

    let delegatable = false;
    let _cocococ: option(PlusOne.instance) = Contract.at(storage.c);
    let _cocococ2 = PlusOne.at(storage.c);
    let _op1 = Contract.self().main(sign, ~amount=0tz);
    let (account_op, _account) =
      Account.create(key_hash, delegate, delegatable, amount[0] + amount[1]);
    let (c_op, c_addr) =
      Contract.create(
        ~manager=key_hash,
        ~delegate,
        ~spendable,
        ~delegatable=true,
        ~amount=amount[0],
        ~storage=9,
        (contract PlusOne),
      );

    let storage = storage.c = c_addr;
    ([account_op, c_op], storage);
  };

The same file can be converted back and forth::

  $ liquidity --convert test19.liq > test19.reliq
  $ liquidity --convert test19.reliq > test19.liq

Beware however that the conversion from ReasonML syntax back to the
OCaml one erases the comments.

ReasonML Syntax Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Liquidity borrows most of ReasonML syntax, with a few changes, similar to
the changes in the OCaml syntax:

* The ``module`` keyword is replaced by the ``contract`` keyword, to define
  contracts and contract signatures
* Tezos-specific literals are available, such as ``12.2tz``,
  ``tz1KqTpEZ7Yob7QbPE4Hy4Wo8fHG8LhKxZSx``, etc.

A good way to learn this syntax is to use the syntax conversion
argument of the compiler (``--convert FILE``).
